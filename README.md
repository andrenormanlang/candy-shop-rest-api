# Candyshop API :inbox_tray:	 :candy:	:outbox_tray:

This is my first REST API for the Medieinstitutet API development course assignment 1. This API should be used as a drop-in replacement for a Candy Webshop that was developed in the Javascript 1 module of the course. 

It includes a create many operation for posting products in bulk and will eventually include user authentication.
