# Candyshop API :inbox_tray:	 :candy:	:outbox_tray:

This is my first REST API for the Medieinstitutet API development course assignment 1. This API should be used as a drop-in replacement for the candy webshop "BortaKv√§ll" that was developed in the Javascript 1 module of the course. 

I would like to eventually to add the update and delete operations to this API in order for it to have all the four basic CRUD operation instead of only two. If possible even add a create many operation as well as user authentication.
